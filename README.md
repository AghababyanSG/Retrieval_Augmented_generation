# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Welcome to the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) repository! This project is dedicated to exploring and implementing state-of-the-art techniques in retrieval-augmented generation for generative AI models.

## Overview

Retrieval-augmented generation is a powerful technique that combines the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with retrieval from a knowledge base or database. This approach allows the generative models to produce more accurate and contextually relevant information by leveraging up-to-date data sources.

## Features

- **State-of-the-Art AI**: Utilize cutting-edge AI techniques for enhanced generative tasks.
- **Data Retrieval**: Seamlessly integrate retrieval mechanisms to fetch relevant information.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle the demands of large-scale AI applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AghababyanSG/Retrieval_Augmented_generation.git
cd Retrieval_Augmented_generation
